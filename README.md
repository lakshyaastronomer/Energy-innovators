Areas for Improvement

Content Completion: Some sections (e.g., game or specific SDG pages) appear incomplete or lack full interactivity. Adding more content and refining interactive elements would enhance engagement.
3D Model Integration: While mentioned in the project description, the 3D models were not prominently featured or fully functional in some areas. Ensuring these are seamlessly integrated would elevate the experience.
Performance: Certain pages load slowly, possibly due to unoptimized assets. Implementing lazy loading and compressing images could improve speed.
Game Functionality: The educational game, while promising, could benefit from clearer instructions and additional features to boost user engagement.

Suggestions

Enhance the 3D model viewers with intuitive controls and tooltips to guide users.
Add more interactive elements, such as quizzes or progress trackers, to the SDG pages.
Optimize asset sizes and leverage lazy loading to improve page load times.
Expand the educational game with levels, rewards, or multiplayer features to increase replayability.

Future Enhancements

New Features: Introduce quizzes, simulations, or user dashboards for personalized learning.
Content Updates: Add case studies, recent data, or new sustainability topics.
